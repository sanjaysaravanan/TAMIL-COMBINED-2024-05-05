  Joins in SQL:
    Joins are used to retrieve data from 2 or more related tables. In general
    tables are related to each other with foreign key constraints

    Use Col_Name like,
      <table_name>.<col_name>
      Eg: Student.name, Teacher.name, Teacher.Subject, Student.Mark

    Normalization:
      Storing different component in different table and relating them together
      with a foreign key.

      Process of removing repeating data is also called normalization.

    Inner Join:

      SELECT column, another_table_column, …
      FROM mytable
      INNER/LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOIN another_table 
          ON mytable.id = another_table.id
      WHERE condition(s)
      ORDER BY column, … ASC/DESC
      LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;

    
    Outer Join:
      LEFT
      RIGHT
      FULL

  CREATE:
  insert:
    INSERT INTO tablename
    (column, another_column, …)
    VALUES (value_or_expr, another_value_or_expr, …),
          (value_or_expr_2, another_value_or_expr_2, …),
          …;

  UPDATE:
    UPDATE mytable
    SET column = value_or_expr, 
        other_column = another_value_or_expr, 
        …
    WHERE condition;
